this is a thing idk, it optimises png, json, and mcmeta files (or you can choose not to optimise the text files)
use: go into the project directory (the directory that has the package.json in it), and create a folder called `original`. inside this folder, put your resourcepack files (not zip) into it. then open up a terminal, cd into the project directory (not original folder), and run `npm start`. the output files will be put into a folder called `optimised`
